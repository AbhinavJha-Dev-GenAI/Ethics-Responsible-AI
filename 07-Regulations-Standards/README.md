# 07. Regulations & Standards 📜📡

Compliance is no longer optional for AI. Governments worldwide are creating frameworks to ensure AI safety and privacy.

## 1. The EU AI Act 🇪🇺

The world's first comprehensive AI law based on **Risk Levels**:
*   **Unacceptable Risk**: (e.g., Social scoring, biometric identification in public). BANNED.
*   **High Risk**: (e.g., Recruitment, Credit scoring, Healthcare). Requires strict auditing, documentation, and human oversight.
*   **Limited Risk**: (e.g., Chatbots). Requires transparency (users must know they are talking to an AI).

## 3. Privacy Laws (GDPR, CCPA) 🔐

These focus on how training data is collected and stored.
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Can you "unlearn" a specific user's data from a model? (Machine Unlearning).
- **Consent**: Explicit permission needed for using data for training.

## 🛠️ Essential Checklist for Developers
- [ ] Is my model "High Risk" under the EU AI Act?
- [ ] Do I have an audit trail of the training data?
- [ ] Have I performed an "AI Impact Assessment"?
- [ ] is my system status page clear about AI usage?

## 📉 Summary
Regulatory compliance is becoming as important as model performance. Engineers who understand these frameworks are highly valuable to enterprise teams.
